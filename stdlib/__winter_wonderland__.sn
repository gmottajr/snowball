/**
 * @brief Prints the Snowball Poem to the console.
 *
 * The Snowball Poem is a short poem that describes the key features of the Snowball programming language,
 * such as speed, security, object-orientation, and simplicity. This function simply prints the poem to
 * the console using the standard output stream.
 * 
 * ```
 * In the land of Snowball, where the code is king,
 * A language of speed and security we bring.
 * Object-oriented, it makes programming fun,
 * With a high-level view that's second to none.
 * 
 * Simplicity is key, complexity we shun,
 * Writing code is now an easy-run.
 * The power of Snowball, it's easy to see,
 * A language for all, just try it and you'll agree.
 * 
 * Fast and secure, Snowball stands tall,
 * With low-level speed that's the envy of all.
 * So let your code run and your dreams take flight,
 * In the land of Snowball, where everything's right.
 * ```
 * @return i32 - It just exists but we return an integer anyway in order to store it in a constant.
